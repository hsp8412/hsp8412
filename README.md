### Hi there 👋

My name is He(何) Sipeng(斯鹏). "Sipeng" is my first name, and "He" is my family name. 

I'm an undergraduate student at the university of Calgary, Canada. 

My journey:

SFLS -> DUT -> UCalgary

My hobbies: 

- Ukulele
- Sitcoms (HIMYM, The IT Crowd, Friends, TBBT, Modern Family, etc.)
- Hiking (Banff!)
- Traveling (My life goal: taking a trip around the world)
- Postcrossing! (Please contact me if you are also a postcrosser)

What I'm working on recently:

- Learn Angular, ASP.NET core and AWS.
- Leetcode (so much pain)
- Try my best to go to the gym at least one time a week
