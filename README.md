### Hi there 👋

My name is He(何) Sipeng(斯鹏). The first part is my family name, and the second part is my first name.

I'm an undergraduate student at the university of Calgary, Canada.

I'm also working as an intern at the IT department of Alberta Health Services.

My hobbies: 

- Watching sitcoms (HIMYM, The IT Crowd, Friends, TBBT, etc.)
- Hiking (That's why I love Calgary and Alberta!)
- Traveling (Taking a trip around the world is my dream)
- News and International Politics (I can talk about them for a whole day)
- Postcrossing! (Please contact me if you are also a postcrosser)

What I'm working on recently:

- Learning Blue Prism
- Learning C#/Asp.net mvc/Razor Pages (A lot of fun!)
- Leetcode (Painful and enjoyable at the same time)
- Trying to hit the gym 5 times a week
